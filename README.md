# Consistent Splash Potions
Makes it easier to get the maximum duration, health or damage out of splash potions.

`/consistentpots accuracyPercentage <percentage>` changes extra added accuracy for each splash (higher percentages increase the chances of getting more out of a potion, 50 by default).  
`/consistentpots accuracyPercentage` to see the current percentage.
